You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Features

I have made following screens as a part of the assignment

1. Home Page: This is just a landing page for our app. It shows various navigation options of our app in its header and a short description about what our app is.

2. Visualize Screen: This is the page where user enters a date range, select country/region and gets all the graphs corresponding to the specified inputs.

3. Visualize World Map: This is the page where user selects a date, and it shows a world map which is colored for various regions based on the new cases frequency. If we click on a region, the description of all the metrics for that region of that date will be shown.

4. About Page: This page is just a static page which shows the description about our project.
